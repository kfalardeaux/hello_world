Hello there coding world!

My name is Katherine, and I am currently a student in community college trying to learn coding!

The languages I've studied so far are Python, Java, and HTML/CSS.  This semester I'm learning about Unity, database coding with SQL, scripting with PowerShell, and server-side web development with Flask.  

If anyone has any advice, tips, suggestions, or feedback on any of my projects, I would love to hear it!


Thank you for stoping by~!
